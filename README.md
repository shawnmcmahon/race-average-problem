### Overview 

The sailboat race is heating up! The competition is fierce this year and many contestants are expcted to compete. We need a way to find the average minutes it takes to complete the race between all the contestants. This application was created to solve this problem.  

### Format

Users submit race times using the ``HH:MM (AM/PM), DAY X`` 12 hour clock format.

Example: `12:01 AM, DAY 2` / `7:01 PM, DAY 20`
